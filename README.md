Simulation models of unipolar, bipolar, and copolar PWM switching schemes for BLDC motor control

This repository provides simulation models and waveform analysis for three different PWM switching strategies used in BLDC motor control:

- **Unipolar Switching**
- **Bipolar Switching**
- **Copolar Switching** (proposed)

The purpose of this work is to analyze and compare the waveform characteristics, duty patterns, and potential motor response under each switching method.
